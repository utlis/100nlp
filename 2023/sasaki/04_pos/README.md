The zip archive alice.zip contains the novel, Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland (written by Lewis Carroll) distributed on Project Gutenberg, as a text file alice.txt.
Apply a part-of-speech (POS) tagger to the text file, and store the result in another file.
Implement programs that read the POS tagging result and perform the jobs.

For your convenience, the zip archive also includes alice.txt.conll, the novel with part-of-speech labels predicted by Stanford CoreNLP.
It may be a good idea to use matplotlib or Gnuplot for the problems 37, 38, and 39.
